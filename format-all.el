;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Lets you auto-format source code in many languages using the same
;; command for all languages, instead of learning a different elisp
;; package and formatting command for each language.  Just do M-x
;; `format-all-buffer' and it will try its best to do the right thing.
;;
;; Supported languages:
;;
;; - C/C++/Objective-C (clang-format)
;; - CSS/Less/SCSS (prettier)
;; - D (dfmt)
;; - Elixir (mix format)
;; - Elm (elm-format)
;; - Emacs Lisp (native)
;; - Go (gofmt)
;; - GraphQL (prettier)
;; - Haskell (hindent)
;; - JavaScript/JSON/JSX/TypeScript/Vue (prettier)
;; - Kotlin (ktlint)
;; - Markdown (prettier)
;; - OCaml (ocp-indent)
;; - Perl (perltidy)
;; - Python (autopep8)
;; - Ruby (rufo)
;; - Rust (rustfmt)
;; - Shell script (shfmt)
;; - Swift (swiftformat)
;;
;; You will need to install external programs to do the formatting.
;; If `format-all-buffer` can't find the right program, it will try to
;; tell you how to install it.
;;
;; There is currently no before-save hook and no customize variables
;; either, since it's not clear what approach should be taken.  Please
;; see https://github.com/lassik/emacs-format-all-the-code/issues for
;; discussion.
;;
;; Many of the external formatters support configuration files in the
;; source code directory to control their formatting. Please see the
;; documentation for each formatter.
;;
;; New external formatters can be added easily if they can read code
;; from standard input and format it to standard output. Feel free to
;; submit a pull request or ask for help in GitHub issues.

THUNK is a function that implements a particular formatter.  It
takes INPUT (the unformatted source code as a string).  THUNK is
invoked such that the current buffer is an empty temp buffer.  It
should call the formatter on INPUT and write the formatted source
code output to the temp buffer.  It should return (ERRORP
ERRPUT).  ERRORP is a boolean indicating whether the formatter
caused an error and hence the contents of the temp buffer should
be discarded.  ERRPUT is a string containing all error/warning
output from the formatter (ERRPUT can also be nil if there were
no errors or warnings).

Note that in some cases we can use the output of the formatter
even if it produced warnings.  Not all warnings are errors."

given, and the program's stderr contains that regexp, then the
formatting is considered failed even if the exit status is in
OK-STATUSES.  OK-STATUSES and ERROR-REGEXP are hacks to work
around formatter programs that don't make sensible use of their

No disk files are touched - the buffer doesn't even need to be

You will need to install external programs to do the formatting.
If the command can't find the program that it needs, it will try
to tell you how you might be able to install it on your operating
system.  Only Emacs Lisp is formatted without an external program.

A suitable formatter is selected according to the `major-mode' of
the buffer.  Many popular programming languages are supported,
but not all of them by any means, so unfortunately it's still
likely that your favorite language is missing.  It is fairly easy
to add new languages that have an external formatter.
